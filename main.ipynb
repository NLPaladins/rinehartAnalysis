       " 'Later, when I tried to piece together the fragments of that journey, I remembered that my coat, which had been folded and placed beyond my restless tossing, had been rescued in the morning from a heterogeneous jumble of blankets, evening papers and cravat, had been shaken out with profanity and donned with wrath',\n",
       " 'At the time, nothing occurred to me but the necessity of writing to the Pullman Company and asking them if they ever traveled in their own cars',\n",

       " 'The white mist of the river, the grays and blacks of the smoke blended into a half-revealing haze, dotted here and there with fire',\n",
       " 'It was unlovely, tremendous',\n",
       " 'Whistler might have painted it with its pathos, its majesty, but he would have missed what made it infinitely suggestive—the rattle and roar of iron on iron, the rumble of wheels, the throbbing beat, against the ears, of fire and heat and brawn welding prosperity',\n",
       " 'Something of this I voiced to the grim old millionaire who was responsible for at least part of it',\n",
       " 'He was propped up in bed in his East end home, listening to the market reports read by a nurse, and he smiled a little at my enthusiasm',\n",
       " '“I can’t see much beauty in it myself,” he said',\n",

       " 'She read literally and without understanding, using initials and abbreviations as they came',\n",
       " 'But the shrewd old man followed her easily',\n",
       " 'Once, however, he stopped her',\n",
       " '“D-o is ditto,” he said gently, “not _do_',\n",
       " 'As the nurse droned along, I found myself looking curiously at a photograph in a silver frame on the bed-side table',\n",
       " 'It was the picture of a girl in white, with her hands clasped loosely before her',\n",
       " 'Against the dark background her figure stood out slim and young',\n",
       " 'Perhaps it was the rather grim environment, possibly it was my mood, but although as a general thing photographs of young girls make no appeal to me, this one did',\n",
       " 'I found my eyes straying back to it',\n",
       " 'By a little finesse I even made out the name written across the corner, “Alison',\n",
       " 'Mr. Gilmore lay back among his pillows and listened to the nurse’s listless voice',\n",
       " 'But he was watching me from under his heavy eyebrows, for when the reading was over, and we were alone, he indicated the picture with a gesture',\n",
       " '“I keep it there to remind myself that I am an old man,” he said',\n",
       " '“That is my granddaughter, Alison West',\n",
       " 'I expressed the customary polite surprise, at which, finding me responsive, he told me his age with a chuckle of pride',\n",
       " 'More surprise, this time genuine',\n",
       " 'From that we went to what he ate for breakfast and did not eat for luncheon, and then to his reserve power, which at sixty-five becomes a matter for thought',\n",

       " '“The happiest day of my life was when I knew he was safely dead in bed and not hanged',\n",
       " 'If the child had looked like him, I—well, she doesn’t',\n",
       " 'She’s a Gilmore, every inch',\n",
       " 'Supposed to look like me',\n",
       " '“Very noticeably,” I agreed soberly',\n",
       " 'I had produced the notes by that time, and replacing the picture Mr. Gilmore gathered his spectacles from beside it',\n",
       " 'He went over the four notes methodically, examining each carefully and putting it down before he picked up the next',\n",
